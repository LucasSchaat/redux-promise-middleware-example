This project is designed to provide a side-by-side representation of the usage and non-usage of the `redux-promise-middleware` package as part of a React application. It serves as an example to compare and contrast the management of axios requests in the component vs. in a reducer and provides a working example of both cases.

In order to get the application to function correctly, make sure that there are no processes running on Ports `3987` and `3988`. Then open up three terminals in VS Code at the root of your project and run `nodemon ./server/index.js` in the first, run `nodemon ./server/index2.js` in the second, and run `npm start` in the third.

Feel free to mess around with the application and test each of the endpoints. Because each side of the screen is running on different servers, try making different changes to each side and see those changes persist.
